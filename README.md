The most often run command is ```s```, which sells your inventory. If nothing gets sold, you should re-run the command after a second.

After you get some money, you can start to upgrade your tools: ```up p 1``` or ```up s 1```
You can upgrade your pickaxe(p), shovel(s), and axe(a). Sword(w) helps with battles, and hoe(h) helps with your farm.

How to use the shop and armor:

By running the command ```shop```, you can buy armor.
Run ```shop c``` to list the items sold in the shop.
The armor is auto-equipped, but if you want to switch armor, you can use ```equip armor_piece armor_type```
E.G: ```equip leather helmet```
